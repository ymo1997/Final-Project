For now, I have implemented the basic html and css codes for the static pages of the auction site. Since there aren't functional javascript codes, I have wrote some javascript test codes to test some fundamental functions such as users' input, selections, and so on. For example, for the add_item.html, the javascript test code inside the html file is about verifying the selected rating. For the bid_on_item.html, the test code is to alert the bid amount that the user entered. For the login.html, the test code can test the login info. For the purchase_item.html, the test code is about verifying the correct item ID. For the registration.html, the test code can test the user email. For the remove_item.html, the test code is to test the warning about removing an item. In the next step, I will focus on javascript implementation and use some frontend frameworks like React or Angular to enhance the development of the auction site.
