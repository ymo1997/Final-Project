For now, I have implemented the basic html and css codes for the static pages of the auction site. Since there aren't functional javascript codes, I have wrote some javascript test codes to test some fundamental functions such as users' input, selections, and so on. In the next step, I will focus on javascript implementation and use some frontend frameworks like React or Angular to enhance the development of the auction site.
