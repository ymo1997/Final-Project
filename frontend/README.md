# Overview
Some basic HTML and CSS functionalities for the auction website are implemented. Some JavaScript testing codes are included to validate some fundamanetal functionalities, such as users' input, selections, and so on.

# Testing
Blow shows the instructions of some simple Javascript testings:
- **add_item.html**: By choosing the rating score in the selector, the corresponding alert window will pop up.
- **bid_on_item.html**: The test code is to alert the bid amount that the user entered. 
- **login.html**: The test code can test the login info. 
- **purchase_item.html**: The test code is about verifying the correct item ID. 
- **registration.html**: The test code can test the user email. 
- **remove_item.html**: The test code is to test the warning about removing an item. 

Note that, for next steps, more detailed JavaScript implementation will be focused and frontend frameworks like React or Angular will be introduced to enhance the development of the auction site.
